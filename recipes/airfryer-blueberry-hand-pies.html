        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul id="ingredients">
          <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts</li>
          <li>1/2 (21 ounce) can blueberry pie filling</li>
          <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon coarse sugar for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol id="steps">
          <li>
            Roll out each circle of pie dough on a lightly floured surface to
            1/8-inch thickness. Cut circles into the dough using a 3 1/2-inch
            round cookie cutter to make 16 circles (8 from each dough round). If
            you don't have a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter, you can use the mouth of
            a large cup or wide-mouth jar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Moisten the edge of a circle with water, then add 2 tablespoons
            blueberry pie filling in the center (or however much can fit while
            still leaving the edges bare).
          </li>
          <li>
            Place another dough circle on top of the filling and pinch the edges
            of the two dough rounds together to seal. Use a fork to crimp the
            edges to secure them further. Add a slit in the top of the crust
            with a sharp knife. Repeat with the remaining dough circles until
            you have 8 round pies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and spray the
            air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place pies in the basket in a
            single layer (you may need to work in batches). Spray the tops of
            the pies with more cooking spray, and sprinkle the tops with coarse
            sugar.
          </li>
          <li>Cook in the air fryer until golden brown, about 9 minutes.</li>
